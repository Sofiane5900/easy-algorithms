## 📝 Overview

This repository is a personal project where I recreate and reinterpret algorithms from the book *"Grokking Algorithms"* by Aditya Bhargava.  
The goal is not just to reproduce, but also to internalize and visually express the logic behind each algorithm.

## 🚀 Implemented Algorithms

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- 📊 **Array Operations** - Basic array manipulations and operations
- 🔍 **Binary Search** - Efficient searching in sorted arrays
- 🔗 **Linked Lists** - Implementation and operations
- 🔄 **Selection Sort** - Simple sorting algorithm
- 🔁 **Swap Operations** - Basic building block for many algorithms

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```
easy-algorithms/
├── array/
├── binary-search/
├── linked-list/
├── selection-sort/
└── swap/
```

Each directory contains a complete implementation with:
- Source code in C
- Detailed comments explaining the logic
- Example usage

## 📖 Reference

All algorithms are inspired by the book:  
**_"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"_ by Aditya Bhargava.**

I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and visual introduction to algorithms.

## ✍️ Notes

- Every implementation reflects my personal understanding and way of visualizing the problems
- Code structure, comments, and choices may differ from the book to match my own learning process
- This project is mainly for educational and personal development purposes
