# Easy Algorithms

> My implementation of algorithms from _"Grokking Algorithms"_ in C

This repo contains my implementations while reading through Grokking Algorithms. Each file represents my understanding of the concepts, implemented in my own way.

## Current Implementations

```c
binary_search.c    // Find elements efficiently in sorted arrays (divide & conquer)
linked_list.c      // Dynamic data structure for flexible storage
array.c           // Basic array operations and traversal methods
selection-sort.c  // Sort arrays by repeatedly finding the minimum element
swap.c           // Basic value swapping (used in various sorting algorithms)
```

Each implementation includes:
- The core algorithm logic
- My own comments explaining the thought process
- Simple example usage

## About

Based on **"Grokking Algorithms"** by Aditya Bhargava - an excellent book that explains algorithms visually.

My implementations might differ from the book since I:
- Write code in my own style
- Add personal notes about what I learned
- Sometimes try different approaches

Feel free to explore the code or use it for your own learning.
