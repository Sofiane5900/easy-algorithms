## üìù Overview

This repo contains my implementations while reading through Grokking Algorithms. Each file represents my understanding of the concepts, implemented in my own way.


Each directory contains a complete implementation with:
- Source code in C
- Comments explaining the logic
- Example usage

## üìñ Reference

All algorithms are inspired by the book:  
**_"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"_ by Aditya Bhargava.**

</div>

I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and visual introduction to algorithms.

Each implementation includes:
- The core algorithm logic
- My own comments explaining the thought process
- Simple example usage

## About

Based on **"Grokking Algorithms"** by Aditya Bhargava - an excellent book that explains algorithms visually.

My implementations might differ from the book since I:
- Write code in my own style
- Add personal notes about what I learned
- Sometimes try different approaches

Feel free to explore the code or use it for your own learning.

## ü§ù Contributing
