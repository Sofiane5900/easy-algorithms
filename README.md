> **Personal reinterpretation of algorithms from _"Grokking Algorithms"_**  

This repository is a personal project where I recreate and reinterpret algorithms from the book *"Grokking Algorithms"* by Aditya Bhargava.  
The goal is not just to reproduce, but also to internalize and visually express the logic behind each algorithm.

## üìñ Reference

All algorithms are inspired by the book:  
**_"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"_ by Aditya Bhargava.**  
I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and visual introduction to algorithms.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

- Every implementation reflects my personal understanding and way of visualizing the problems.
- Code structure, comments, and choices may differ from the book to match my own learning process.
- This project is mainly for educational and personal development purposes.
